  <h1>For You ❤️</h1>

  <p>
TO MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE, GEENU ❤️<br><br>

I don’t even know where to start, but I just wanna say I love you so much. Like actually.
You’re so beautiful and every time I see you or even think about you it just makes me happy.
I still can’t believe you’re mine sometimes. I never thought a girl like you would ever be in my life,
and now that you are, it just feels crazy in the best way.<br><br>

Being around you is honestly my favourite thing.
I love talking to you, laughing with you, and just doing nothing together.
You make everything better without even trying.
Even on bad days, you somehow make things feel okay again.<br><br>

I think about the future with you a lot.
I know we’re still young, but I really can see myself marrying you one day and having a family together,
like 4 beautiful kids running around and us just being happy.
That thought makes me smile because I can’t imagine doing life with anyone else.<br><br>

You deserve the world and more, and I mean that.
You deserve to be treated like the most important person ever,
and I’m gonna try my best to give you everything I can in life and make sure you’re always happy and cared for.<br><br>

I love you a lot, more than I even know how to explain.
Thank you for being in my life and for loving me the way you do.
I’m really lucky to have you, Geenu. HAPPY VALENTINES DAY MY LOVE ❤️
